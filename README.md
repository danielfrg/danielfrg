Software engineer building Data Engineering and Data Science tools. Here you can find my Open Source projects and contributions.

Most of my work here has been dedicated to the PyData ecosystem. Including development on new libraries and integrations of existing tools to make data science workflows easier and better. It also includes development on ML applications, learning new languages and tools, and more.

10 years of experience in the Data Science and Machine Learning ecosystem in different roles including engineering, product management, and sales plus my experience as a full-stack data software engineer give me a unique perspective on how to solve technical challenges to deliver successful products.
